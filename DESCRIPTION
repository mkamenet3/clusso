Title: Space and space-time cluster detection with Lasso
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: person("Maria", "Kamenetsky", , "maria.kamenetsky@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package efficiently detects cluster in sparse space and
    space-time matrices. Current options are to use the Poisson and quasi-
    Poisson models, the latter allowing for overdispersion. It uses AIC/AICc/
    BIC and their quasi-likelihood equivalents to determine the optimal path.
    These functions parse out clusters from a background rate, smoothing over
    the background rate via the regularization. This package also provides
    extensions for simulations and related simulation diagnostics as well as
    color-coding for easy-to-make maps.
