Title: Space and space-time cluster detection with Lasso
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: person("Maria", "Kamenetsky", , "maria.kamenetsky@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description:    This package efficiently detects across space and space-time using the LASSO 
    (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). Current models include the Poisson and Binomial, 
    as well as their quasi- counter parts, allowing for overdispersion. This package uses information critera 
    ((Q)BIC, (Q)AIC, (Q)AICc) as well as cross-validation to determine the optimal path and thereby number of
    clusters in the study region.
