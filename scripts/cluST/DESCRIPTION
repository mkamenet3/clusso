Title: Space and space-time cluster detection with Lasso
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Maria", "Kamenetsky", , "mkamenetsky@wisc.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package efficiently detects cluster in sparse space and space-time matrices. Current options are to use the Poisson and quasi-Poisson models, the latter allowing for overdispersion. It uses AIC/AICc/BIC and their quasi-likelihood equivalents to determine the optimal path. These functions parse out clusters from a background rate, smoothing over the background rate via the regularization. This package also provides extensions for simulations and related simulation diagnostics as well as color-coding for easy-to-make maps.
